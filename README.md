# Node.js/npm Just installer

A simple Node.js installer for the excellent Just command runner (https://just.systems). This allows
you to install Just as part of the `npm install` command, so you don't have to worry about setting
it up separately. Great for development teams!

Local usage (great for team projects):

```bash
$ npm install -D just-install
# or
$ yarn add -D just-install
```

Or globally:

```bash
$ npm install -g just-install
# or
$ yarn global add just-install
```

> Now with Windows support!

## Purpose

Using Just is an excellent option for a more robust command runner in your Node.js projects.
However, it requires installing Just on your system as a separate installation step, using one
of the various package managers for your system of choice.

If you want to remove the extra setup step of installing Just when developing a Node.js
application, this utility will install a local, standalone binary as part of the `npm install`
command.

After installation, the `just` command will work in npm scripts:

```json
// package.json:

{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "just start"
  }
}
```

Or with `npx`:

```bash
$ npx just start
```

It's great for teams who want to make the set up process for their project as easy as possible.

# Implementation notes

This utility executes Just by spawning a child process from Node.js and passing through all stdio
from the Just executable. This is necessary due to technical reasons for Windows and Yarn users, 
so to avoid an overly-complex installation process, it works this way for Mac and Linus users too. 
I don't expect this to cause any issues, but it might be worth noting.
