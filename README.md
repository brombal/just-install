# Node.js/npm Just installer

A simple Node.js installer for the excellent Just command runner (https://just.systems).

Local usage (great for team projects):

```bash
$ npm install -D just-install
```

Or globally:

```bash
$ npm install -g just-install
```

## Purpose

Using Just is an excellent option for a more robust command runner in your Node.js projects. 
However, it requires installing Just separately from the `npm install` command, using one
of the various package managers for your system of choice. 

If you want to remove the extra setup step of installing Just before developing a Node.js 
application, this utility will install a local, standalone binary as part of the `npm install` 
command.

After installation, the `just` command will work in npm scripts:

```js
// package.json:

{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "just start"
  }
}
```

Or with `npx`:

```bash
$ npx just start
```

It's great for teams who want to make the set up process for their project as easy as possible.

# Implementation notes

- The installer script from Just is included in this repo and modified slightly because as of this 
  writing, the `--tlsv1.3` flag used for curl does not seem to work on MacOS Ventura (13.1). It
  has been replaced with `--tlsv1.2`. Hopefully this will be resolved either by Just or Apple 
  (haha).

- Yarn cannot execute non-JS scripts as binaries. The workaround is to make the binary a JS file 
  that executes the Just binary (using `child_process.execFileSync()`). There is an outstanding 
  issue on yarn's Github (https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/issues/882); hopefully there will be some 
  resolution eventually.
