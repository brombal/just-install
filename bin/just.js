/**
 * This file is a pass-through for the actual just binary. It exists because for two reasons:
 *
 * - Yarn does not allow references to anything other than .js files in the "bin" field in package.json.
 * - Windows does not allow executing binaries that don't end in .exe, and we need the package.json "bin" field to
 *   point to the same file on all platforms.
